# Load raw data
Each file defines a raw dataloader for a task with a specific setting, using [HuggingFace Datasets](https://huggingface.co/datasets). 

To add a task with a specific setting, you may want to **check** [HuggingFace Datasets](https://huggingface.co/datasets). 
Some datasets already have raw dataloaders, and you can copy them to this directory.
Otherwise, you need to implement it and then **contribute to** [HuggingFace Datasets](https://huggingface.co/datasets).

Please refer to the files under this directory for more details.
